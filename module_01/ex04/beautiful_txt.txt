"I brought you here to remind you
that football is a fucking game that
you used to play as a fucking kid.
Cause it was fun, even when you were
getting your fucking legs broken. Or your
fucking feelings hurt. So fuck your feelings,
fuck your over thinking, fuck all that bullshit,
go back out there and have some fucking fun." â€“ Roy Kent
