//TODO : things to check
- If I have Bob and George fighting; do I need to make sure
to print msg to tell number of points gain or lost
- If Bob attacks, call takeDamage in the main for George
to lose his points
- ajouter msg quand plus de hitpts(vie) ou energie. If _hitPts > 0 &&
_energyPts > 0: fait les actions. ELSE: msg de mort
