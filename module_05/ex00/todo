/*			THINGS TO DO			*/
1. Create a class Bureaucrat. Concrete class, so must follow canonical form
	- needs a constant name
	- a grade: ONLY between 1 to 150!!! IMPORTANT
	- when instantiate a Bureaucrat, it must be a valid grade, otherwise
	throw exception.
	- nested class of exception. Bureaucrat::GradeTooHighException or a 
	Bureaucrat::GradeTooLowException
	- needs getName() and getGrade()
	- needs setters to increment and decrement grade. Needs to be done in 2 functions
	why??? not sure //QUESTION...
