/*
What I have to do:

<template><>
class Array
	Default Constructor: no parameter. But creates an empty array
	Constructor(unsigned int n): creates an array of n elements initialized by default
		About this constructor: Tip: Try to compile int * a = new int(); then display *a.??? What do they mean???
	Constructor by Copy: must NOT affect the other array
	Assignment operator: must NOT affect the other array
	member function: unsigned int size(void). Does NOT modify the current instance.


***MUST USE new[] to ALLOCATE MEMORY***


Elements can be accessed through the subscript operator: []. Like element[indexMachin]
IF index is out of bounds, THROW std::exception
